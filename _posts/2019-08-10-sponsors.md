This conference could not happen without the collaboration and support of our financial and in-kind sponsors, individual donors, strategic partners, andn volunteers . Thank you!

As a not-for-profit, and volunteer-driven endeavor, Pista ng Mapa rely on hundreds of donated work hours that go into planning, organizing and running the conference. As a free-of-charge conference, organizers seek the support of organizations and donors to provide significant financial assistance to successfully host the event. 

The generosity of our volunteer-advocates, and community supporters (individuals, corporations, NGOs) are crucial in helping us promote our goal of advancing the use of free software and open (geo)data, and grow local communities outside the capital region of the Philippines. Every donation matters and is deeply appreciated. Donors are acknowledged in several ways in the conference. Contributions at higher tiers are also entitled to additional privileges and expressions of appreciation.
